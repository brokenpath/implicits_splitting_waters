# idea
create a three part lecture. 

#  part 1 (overview)
Set the very basic foundation to read the code (fast forward track).
object, trait, case class, Generics.
make a guess exercise, to make sure generics are fairly understood.
Make a fiddle exercise, of making the types fit (good to see error messages).

# part 2 (Implicits as contexts and typeclasses)
Take the two most used parts with spark, (maybe find a conversation thats hard to figure out without context)
implicits as dependency inject, config etc.
Show error message when there is no implicit.

how to write parser and reuse the parts when things are part of other things.
Use example from hands on scala.
Make a task to create a parser for a small language, to make it stick.


# part 3 (spark and encoders)
Show how this transfers into spark.
